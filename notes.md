Dante AI requirement:


Please review this API document. I want to combine this capability with the Dante AI Agent, to give it a face and a persona. So the idea is to be able to capture the text output from the Dante AI, submit it through the D-ID API and have the Avatar speak the response as it is also written...like this example 
https://chat.d-id.com/


I want to add a "AI" module at the operations level, so the Operator has the the ability to create a new Dante knowledge base using their custom written "user manual" or use our generic one, and create a avatar using D-IDs APIs, and then use your magic to combine them, and create a space on each page where you can call up the avatar agent and ask it questions. if that make sense...Let me know. Please assign someone on the team with interest and capability to work on this, and set up a sub group to allow us to chat and drive this...this should only be implemented on our AWS system and our demo property.
